00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.000
Oh, always keep me in your thoughts

00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:02.000
If there’s anything, share it with me

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Whenever I’m near you

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Just look at me, leaving the rest aside

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:05.000
I’ll step onto the threshold of your heart

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:06.000
But you don’t shut the door on me

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:07.000
Like the moon, hidden behind the clouds

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Don't hide yourself from me

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:09.000
Follow my words, without you, my heart feels off

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:10.000
It's not at ease

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:11.000
Don't part from me

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:12.000
Don't part from me

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:13.000
Like the moon hidden behind the clouds

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:14.000
Don't hide yourself from me

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:15.000
Follow my words, without you, my heart feels off

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:16.000
It's not at ease

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:17.000
Don't part from me

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:18.000
Don't part from me

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:19.000
Like the waves of the ocean

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:20.000
My life is full of turns and twists

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:21.000
Where this will take me, I don't know

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:22.000
I don't know what it says

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:23.000
Like the high and long mountains

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:24.000
You seem both near and far

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:25.000
Where there is no sign

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:26.000
Even rain falls there

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:27.000
If I don’t see you

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:28.000
My heart finds no peace

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:29.000
Whatever happens, happens for good

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:30.000
The world just says lies

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:31.000
When the birds fly away

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:32.000
They don’t need the home anymore

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:33.000
Don’t you get lost anywhere

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:34.000
Don’t you get lost anywhere

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:35.000
Like the moon hidden behind the clouds

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:36.000
Don't hide yourself from me

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:37.000
Follow my words, without you, my heart feels off

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:38.000
It's not at ease

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:39.000
Don't part from me

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:40.000
Don't part from me

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:41.000
Like the moon hidden behind the clouds

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:42.000
Don't hide yourself from me

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:43.000
Follow my words, without you, my heart feels off

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:44.000
It's not at ease

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:45.000
Don't part from me

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:46.000
Don't part from me

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:47.000
Oh, I talk

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:48.000
and you come into my conversation

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.000
You should bring your talks

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:50.000
And mix them with mine

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:51.000
You start your day with my photo

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:52.000
& spend the evening with me

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:53.000
Take care of yourself, protect yourself

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:54.000
Give me your sorrows, keep your happiness with you

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:55.000
Do whatever your heart desires

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:56.000
Take care of yourself

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:57.000
Take care of yourself

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:58.000
& sleep peacefully

00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:59.000
& sleep peacefully

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:00.000
Like the moon hidden behind the clouds

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:01.000
Don't hide yourself from me

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:02.000
Follow my words, without you, my heart feels off

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:03.000
I can't find peace

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:04.000
Don't part from me

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:05.000
Don't part from me

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:06.000
Like the moon hidden behind the clouds

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:07.000
Don't hide yourself from me

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:08.000
Follow my words, without you, my heart feels off

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:09.000
It's not at ease

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:10.000
Don't part from me

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:11.000
Don't part from me

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:12.000
Like the moon hidden behind the clouds

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:13.000
Don't hide yourself from me

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:14.000
Follow my words, without you, my heart feels off

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:15.000
It's not at ease

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:16.000
Don't part from me

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:17.000
Don't part from me
